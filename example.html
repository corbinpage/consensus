<p>I saw that as well (posted on techmeme) and was going to post it here. However it seemed to take the position that the election results (for Brexit/US Pres) were not fair because things were gamed in what (speculatively on the writer's part) was an unfair way.  Doesn't mention that social media played a huge role in the election of 2008 which could be viewed in the same way. In other words  what you read as being truth.</p><p>To wit:</p><p></p><blockquote>In February 2007, a friend called Marc Andreessen, a founder of Netscape and a board member of Facebook, and asked if he wanted to meet with a man with an idea that sounded preposterous on its face.....He wondered if social networking, with its tremendous communication capabilities and aggressive database development, might help him beat the overwhelming odds facing him.</blockquote><p></p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10carr.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11...</a></p>

<p>Google has problems understanding us. Their senior people are predominantly mathematicians and computer scientists, so their mental models are that intelligence and language are just about mathematics.</p><p>The idea that language is probabilistic makes no sense.</p><p>The reason is simple. Probability is a man-made invention from 1654 to model the random behavior of unbiased dice. Dice which has no consciousness (construct of internal self and relationship with external others), no language, no culture and no thinking abilities.</p><p>Moreover, language PRECEDED probability and, likely, even mathematics itself.</p><p>John Von Neumann: "When we talk mathematics, we may be discussing a secondary language built on the primary language of the nervous system."</p><p>So that's why Google is stuck and can't solve the problem. Language understanding is not about frequency counts of clicks or probabilistic correlations of links.</p><p><span></span><div class="media-container media-mode-deferred">

<p>Maybe it is that we are modelling artificial intelligence with the wrong tools.</p><p>As powerful and cost effective as hardware has got,  I think we still lack the proper languages to build the models to express AI. Its also possible that the way our tools work is contaminating our view of the models and even the problem itself.</p><p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer" rel="nofollow noopener">https://aeon.co/essays/your-br...</a></p><p>P.S.: I agree with what it is said in the article about how far are we from understanding every interaction going on inside the brain which combined produces our individual intelligence. But I think that we can produce convincing, comfortable, and useful enough versions of AI before that, the milestone of total understanding of our mind.</p><p>And also, this 'collective mind' social phenomena as expressed in our time, is something *completely new*. Turning this into a form of 'proactive and collective intelligence' may beat AI, as a tool,  during it first steps.</p>

<p>Does this new OS involve SV techco's being able to control the OS of our brains themselves via neuro-transplants and nano-bots?</p><p>So then President-elect Trump will not only be able to game the algorithms and fake news in search, social networks etc but also directly manipulate our brains? Please see attached screenshot.</p><p>I completely agree with the concerns you shared in the 'Wired' interview with President Obama: "I feel like this is the year that artificial intelligence becomes more than just a computer science problem. Everybody needs to understand that how AI behaves is important. In the Media Lab we use the term extended intelligence. Because the question is, how do we build societal values into AI?"</p><p>According to Peter Diamandis and others, we don't need to do that. We all just need the silicate brain implants and that will (somehow) control the AI and teach it about language, culture, empathy, social values, ethics etc.</p><p>It won't and it can't, imo. And we should ALL be thinking the AI through and we should all be integral parts of the design and development of AI.</p><p>Then the AI would actually be more representative and reflective of our collective human intelligence.</p><p>George Magnus, the former Chief Economist of UBS, makes an important distinction between this Machine Age of Information Revolution from that of the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>In the Industrial Revolution, the machines were designed to replace our brawn.</p><p>In this Information Revolution, the machines are designed to replace our brains (but, in fact, only our intelligence as mathematically definable rather than our whole intelligence).</p><p>If we get this wrong, the language, the ethics, the social and cultural values which our species has built up since Homo Erectus became Homo Sapiens will be negatively affected.</p><p> <span></span><div class="media-container media-mode-deferred">

If "culture is our OS" then that reality is a major road block to social progress/survival!</p><p>"Collective Human Intelligence" is a tough nut to crack when billions of souls can not even take the bottom few rungs of Maslow's hierarchy of needs for granted.

That imperative now simply wells up from the underling causal organizational necessity of it all.</p><p></p><blockquote>As regards:</blockquote><p>"the language, the ethics, the social and cultural values which our species has built up since Homo Erectus"</p><p>Those too need a major rework around our new technologically immovable reality of universal social interdependency.</p><p>So there we have it our contemporary "Chicken or Egg" problem.</p>

<p>Tom Friedman's new book "Thank You for Being Late" addresses some of these same themes.  The themes that I think are causing worldwide anxiety, protectionism at massive scale, fear.  These same themes should be viewed as massive opportunities to change the world for the better, too, but I realize that's not evident or agreed to by large swathes of people because they've not seen in action how that makes their life better (microeconomics versus macroeconomics).</p>
