<p>I'm not sure I like this approach. <br>We're mixing efficient robots/algorithms with people's feelings and opinions. The definition of "objectionable" can be subjective, and it could mean left vs. right, liberal vs. conservative, etc. So it ends up polarizing issues further and keeping people divided. <br>This could end up being like whack a mole. <br>If you don't like a site, don't visit it. <br>I'm not a fan of blacklisting. It's a cope out for dealing with an issue head on. </p>

<p>Sometimes initiatives that look like cop-outs turn into clever flanking maneuvers. I understand your reasons why this approach might be sub-optimal but going up against adtech generally is audacious and maybe foolhardy. I forwarded this post to my good friend and colleague Doc Searls. Doc has been valiantly leading the charge for Project VRM, a Berkman Center effort to tame the adtech beast, especially the way it tracks us across the web (customers managing vendors instead of the opposite, aka CRM). Sleeping Giants is an opening. If it takes off it becomes flanking maneuver. It along with Doc's work and its progeny (from open protocols to new startups) might flip the table here in a meaningful way. That would be good even if some day in hindsight we say "well that blacklisting thing was pretty messy."</p>

<p>I think I have him writing on this now which will be better than what I could say. But, two thoughts came to mind. You have consumers opting out on the tracking side. Now we have brands opting out on the outreach side. That's destabilization of an industry. It follows (in my fevered imagination) that destabilization along that value chain might lead to new alignment. That new alignment ends up meeting the VRM objective of giving consumers more autonomy. I.e., brands might start seeing consumers as their partners in protecting the brand while consumers experience this as asserting their intentions.</p>

<p>Both Doc and La Vonne are great champions of this cause and they do awesome work. Thank you !</p><p>The question really goes back to if the parts of ad-tech outside of a) search, and b) brand advertising sold directly by publishers are delivering a positive ROI to brands. If not, can there be a better alternative to helping buyers find sellers in a way that is more respectful of the buyer's time, interests, personal data and privacy ? Project VRM does provide a framework and set of tools that are forward looking and visionary.</p>

<p>Blacklisting &lt;&gt; banning. This is just a feedback loop for a brand that might be listening to the social media channel but not the programmatic channel. Up to the brand to decide whether to act on the new information provided through the increased transparency. I think what you're describing is a situation in which publishers become invisible based on the subjective judgment of individuals - that's closer to what happens when FB or GOOG change their algorithms than to what Sleeping Giants is doing. Particularly if FB or GOOG also now heed the calls for them to censor the news.</p>

<p>Yes, but brands do need more awareness on how ad-tech works and the ad-tech companies have a responsibility to be more transparent and provide black and white lists for advertisers that each can choose in accordance with what they want their brand to be associated with.</p><p>I bet an advertiser would never agree to put a 30 second spot on a pornographic TV channel or a racist magazine, so why do they want to allow it on the internet ?</p>

<p>I do wonder if brands really understand all the downsides of targeting advertising to people and following them around the web?</p><p>Without the right context, advertising is worse than noise. The brand gets tainted by what its ad is surrounded by and may leave a permanent mark on the prospect. It also violates a cardinal principle: Advertising need not help, but it should never harm the brand...</p><p>Add to this the general consumer apathy to display ads, rampant fraud, flawed measurement systems, and imprecise attribution to the final sale, it is time for marketers to question the real value of a) programmatic and b) non-search advertising sold through intermediaries, and not directly by publishers.</p><p>The messy stack of ad-tech companies that participate in brokering ads to people are the modern day equivalent of black magic.</p><p>They seem to work, but do they really? They seem to deliver millions of impressions, but can we know the real impact (both positive and negative)? The agency declares a great ROI, but do we really know for sure ? No, No and No, and it is time for people to call the BS.</p>

<p>When I did programmatic banner ad purchasing for some political campaigns the headache and outrage it caused was a bit absurd. The vendor I worked with was able to blacklist by certain categories (i.e. porn) but not all sites were necessarily included. They had to be in the URL blacklist. The most contentious was definitely advertising related to firearm related websites. A candidate I worked with is pro-gun control and the gun people were up in arms when they saw his ads on some of the websites they went to. Both upset with the candidate for advertising there and also the website for accepting the ads. Fortunately the candidate understood how things worked and we were generally ok with this since those people were never going to vote for us anyways I did not really care if they had strong feelings about the ads. However we did add sites to the blacklist as we got the feedback to save a few pennies.</p><p>Overall the issue, in my mind, is that how these display ads are used differ from consumer understanding and expectations. It'd be great if the ad-tech folks who are flush with money would work on educating the public more. I think there also could be some more work put into improving the existing blacklists.</p>

<p>We should fight bad things any way we can -- directly and indirectly. But in this case, pressing advertisers to disassociate themselves from sites that reflect badly on their brand -- sites that can stay in business from that association -- feels pretty "direct." The advertiser can come out ahead here if they get better alignment among themselves, their customers, and the media that that customers trust.</p>

<p>I think it is worth mentioning that the majority (if not totality?) of blacklisted site tweets so far are only about Breitbart.  Without making any comment about the target, I would just note that reading the tweets makes it reasonably clear that the intent of the account is initially and specifically targeted at Breitbart.</p>

<p>Breitbart is the site everyone knows about because of the association with the Trump campaign, now the Trump administration-to-be, and secondarily because of some of the nonsense peddled there; but I would welcome a pointer to other hate sites and I'd flag them up to advertisers whose products or services I value.</p>

<p>As I understand it, this is not about trying to conceal something or limit access to it; it's about trying to highlight an association that one party might prefer to avoid. In the ideal outcome, a publisher will ask an advertiser like Kellogg's, "how can we get you back?" to which a sensible answer might be "stop publishing vicious nonsense."</p>

<p>My point is that if someone feels that a site is offensive then bringing attention to it will create more readers. For example I never heard of Breitbart until the election.   An article saying "Kelloggs n' Breitbart" is ultimately good for Breitbart or potentially another objectionable (in the eyes of the beholder) site.</p>

<p>Yes, in today's world, all publicity is good. Negative attention that makes a site a pariah will drive attention and increase readership. Unfortunately, that is the way human nature works, especially when there is polarization and our definitions of good and bad are all very different.</p>

<p>Agreed -- that's definitely a risk. The hope is that the few extra eyeballs will be less valuable than the lost revenue. I doubt that my looking at a Breitbart page has any upside for Breitbart, whereas my custom with an advertiser by definition is of value to that advertiser.</p><p>Clearly the Kellogg's boycott got the attention of people in the Breitbart organization, suggesting that a nerve was struck and that the revenue implications are non-trivial. More generally (as is discussed by other commenters), I see this as just a test of what will probably be a multiplicity of approaches to the fake news / hate speech problem and the inadvertent support for fake news and hate speech generated by today's ad-industry structure and ad-tech.</p>

<p>I kind of reject on it's face the idea that an advertiser should be boycotted as a result of where their advertising ends up either knowingly or unknowingly. I don't like that type of crowd justice (even if it's called protest or boycott).  While there are probably going to be some obvious exceptions to this it gives to much power and control to mobs of people.</p><p>To be clear what I mean is I don't like the idea of people saying they will boycott Kelloggs because their advertising appears on a site like Breitbart. (As opposed to perhaps Kelloggs sponsoring the Nazi parade which has no chance of happening but I would support as an clear extreme).</p>

<p>Agreed (again). The thought is not that one would boycott Kellogg's, just advise them that the Kellogg's &lt;&gt; Breitbart connection is possibly a connection they would prefer to avoid. Over time, if as you say Kellogg's starting sponsoring extremist marches, that would suggest stronger action. From Kellogg's perspective, this is possibly an opportunity to state their brand values, which I imagine include wholesomeness, inclusion and due regard for science.</p>

<p>I think the ship has sailed on incentivization.</p><p>It's very clear that certain individuals will put in effort when not getting paid rather than be given a trivial amount of money. Karma over $$. This is one of the reasons (not the entire reason) that people help friends move for pizza but probably wouldn't do it if asked for $5 per hour.  Ditto for attorneys. Will do pro bono work but not work for $75 per hour.</p><p>There are examples of people in the real world doing things that don't result in a large amount of money (green stamps, certain coupons etc.) but I am not seeing it as a driving force of online behavior.</p>

<p>Agreed - just commented about it above.  This is a boycott/divestment strategy...  My fear is that there is a universal trend towards tribalism right now that is not likely to penetrate increasingly polarized and opposite viewpoints in the country and the world.  Killing Breitbart is only a short term fix (e.g. chopping off one of a hydra's heads) -- the much bigger question is how can the readers of Breitbart be engaged and connected with such that they voluntarily stop reading the site?  That's a more permanent and structural solution.</p>

<p>I'd agree with you if this was literally about banning publishers from the internet. But that's not what this is about. This is just about reporting an association that a brand may want to review because it may be one they are unaware of and would be unlikely to support. i.e., the resulting action here is not that a publisher is being banned - it is that a brand is opting out of a particular association IF lots of people report it, and the publisher only goes broke IF all brands decide to act on it. i.e., the judgment and resulting action here doesn't sit with an individual, it sits with the brands and with the collective wisdom of the crowd. So one person reporting something might not lead to a brand pulling out, but if millions of people point it out the brand may well consider it. The aggregate signal matters.</p><p>Separately, the issue with satire in news is particularly complicated. Malcolm Gladwell tackles it in his excellent podcast Revisionist History. But even so, the main point is still that if millions of people suggest there is a negative association resulting from a piece of satire, or any other content, it's probably something the brand would (and should) review. In fact, brands already do try to do this through social media listening tools. The point of Sleeping Giants is just that this channel (i.e. programmatic) suffers from a lack of transparency and so this is an attempt to fix that by creating a feedback loop. Very different from an arbitrary and knee-jerk decision to ban a publisher from the internet - ironically the very thing people seem to be asking Facebook, Google et. al. to do.</p>

<p>Many good points. But one thing I am (still) worried about is this:</p><p><b>"IF lots of people report it"</b></p><p>There are many ways to game that by getting a cabal together.   Then typically as we have seen most brands would tend to bend under what <b>appears</b> to be overwhelming pressure (I can just hear the headlines on the Nightly News they call it 'mounting pressure from...' and then they build a story around it because people can't interpret what the significance of the numbers are.</p>

<p>It's possible, but let's say the mechanism does get hijacked - i.e., a sinister cabal games the system and pressures a brand to pull ads from a credible / satirical source. The brand can still decide whether to cave to mounting pressure.... or to turn it into a statement about their principles, beliefs, etc. and in the process engender greater loyalty from people outside the cabal, a la Kellogg and Breitbart.</p>

<p>Programmatic has lead to the commodization of adv. It's all about impressions and cpms w/ increasingly less importance placed on qualitative issues, such as editorial compatibility. The ad community has no one to blame but themselves for the growth of ad blocking tech, plus when sites like Breitbart suggest it's heresy for an advertiser to discontinue adv on its site's due to inconsistencies w/ the company's core values, you got to question who is running the asylum. Adv need to modify the buying process and elevate qualitative criteria to address inefficiencies in targeting and editorial compatibility. </p>

<p>I think that the ad networks should offer a whitelist option as well, it is easier to decide where you want to place your ad than to try to blacklist every low quality website.</p><p>It would also be good for media companies, they could use their sales teams to convince agencies to whitelist them and it would end up raising rates for premium ad space from branding while letting pure performance players to spread their ads on the lower priced, higher ROI of non premium sites.</p>
